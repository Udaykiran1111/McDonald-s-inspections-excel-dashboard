# McDonald-s-inspections-excel-dashboard
This interactive Excel dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of health and safety inspections conducted across various McDonald's locations. It is designed to help management monitor compliance, identify trends, and improve operational standards at a glance.
The McDonald’s  Inspections Dashboard, an interactive visualization built entirely in Microsoft Excel, presents a comprehensive analysis of restaurant inspection data from New York City — specifically focused on McDonald’s locations. Using foundational tools such as Pivot Tables, Slicers, and Dynamic Charts, the dashboard transforms raw public data into clear, actionable insights for food safety analysis and operational evaluation.
The motivation behind developing this dashboard lies in exploring various critical aspects of restaurant inspections, such as:
1.	Inspection score trends and grade distribution
2.	Critical vs non-critical violation patterns
3.	Inspection type performance comparison
4.	Grade distribution across boroughs and time
5.	Inspection count and trends by cuisine type
Through this Excel dashboard, users can explore inspection outcomes interactively — filtering data by boroughs, grades, time periods, and violation severity. Every chart and table within the dashboard is slicer-connected, enabling seamless exploration and dynamic storytelling through the data.
This project stands as a demonstration of how user-friendly, non-programmatic tools like Excel can deliver robust capabilities in data analysis and visualization. It serves as a valuable resource for students, public health analysts, and researchers interested in understanding inspection dynamics in the fast-food industry — particularly within a real-world urban setting.
